# IAE-101
Digital Intelligence, by **Professor Christopher Kane** and **Professor Jean Graham**. Taken **Fall 2020** in **Stony Brook Unversity**

This beginner programming class uses **Python** as its primary coding language, teaching students the logistics of how python works while also teaching the history of coding. There were four projects.

### Mozart's Musical Dice Project
This project composes a waltz of 272 available sound clips. From those 272 clips, it pastes 32 pre-composed musical elements at random. Added by multiple folders, M, M-2, and T. They all represent all the .wav files that plays the audio.

### Sierpinski Triangle
Utilizing recursion, this project uses computer drawing and the pygame library to draw Sierpinski triangles, which is a fractal pattern.

### Poetry Generator
Using random word generators, it creates a pattern of poems. I chose the haiku pattern.

### Twitter Bot
This Twitter bot is essentially a set of reminders every half-day. By utilizing a random number generator, I make it so that my bot sends a random "Did you..." reminder. The tweet also has a random picture too. The twitter account can be seen here: https://twitter.com/iae101lawliu.
